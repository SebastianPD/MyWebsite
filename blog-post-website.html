                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">There will come a day when I die. As I lay in a void desensitized by reality, coming to grips with my mortality, I will see nothing but the events of my life. I surround myself in a garden full of achievements with a statue of
                            my proudest moment. I will feel happy for the last time. </p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">This happiness will soon turn to fear and shame when the garden decays in front of me to reveal the hidden horrors of my repressed memories. I will be in a state of disarray, which will turn into anguish once the surface of the
                            statue peels away to reveal my greatest regret. </p>
                        <p class="text-center d-xl-flex flex-wrap justify-content-xl-center" style="padding-bottom: 0px;width: 3px;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;|</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">I am talking about my high school&nbsp;<a href="#">website</a>... I know, totally justified. You see, this abomination was made because it was a requirement for my engineering class. This was the way our teacher managed us, and
                            it needed to have specific requirements. It needed to have a resume, a document answering 10 questions, and a picture of me.</p>
                        <p>Me being the akward wall flower that I am, I screwed up the picture because I did not know how to look at a camera.&nbsp;<br>I was told it was bad from my classmates, but I didn't care and just used it. Once the class was over
                            the website was a distant memory, until I went to college.</p>

                        <h4>When my college friends found out</h4>
                        <p>I was just crying over chemistry like any average college student when I got a snap from my friend Lili. She and some of our friends were reenacting the Shia LaBeouf song. I thought it was weird until I saw The Shia-surprise. Needless
                            to say, I became cold, and my heart sank faster than the market on black Tuesday. They found my terrible selfie and put it on TV. </p>

                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/ref.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure." style="height: 581px;">
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Raf, loves corn and podcasts, hit him up he's single.</figcaption>

                            <div class="col" style="width: 537px;">
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Now I got over that event quickly, what really killed me was the fact that they were not the only people who found my site. At the site's peak, it was getting 300 unique visitors per month. What kind of person goes to a
                                    dead website? My conclusion is that since I went to college, I was slowly more relevant to Google. I am getting into the professional world with my LinkedIn, GitHub, and my photos are now appear in google searches.
                                    I needed a new website because of my increasing involvement online, and I was pretty transparent about my conclusion with my friends, big mistake. </p>
                                <p>&lt;---- THIS MAN took a domain I was going to use and linked it to my Weebly site!<br>He took <a href="https://sebastianperezdelgado.com">sebastianperezdelgado.com</a>&nbsp;and if this link still goes to my Weebly site
                                    he still hasn't given it to me yet.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Well I can't really fight it.</h4>
                        <p>I decided to keep both websites. The Weebly site is pretty relevant and not to mention I can link them to each other, making this site also appear in Google searches.</p>
