                        <div class="post-info"><span>By Sebastian Perez-Delgado</span><span>Aug 27, 2019</span></div>
                        <p>So...<br><br>College... <br><br>I always knew I wanted to go to college, but I just didn't know how to start. My parents were no help, they never went to school in America. Luckily, I wasn't completely blind. I had the internet,
                            and despite horror stories of New Mexico's education system, I had a pretty good high school counselor. I made a list of colleges and applied like a mad-man. Northwestern was one of those schools I applied to. I found out it
                            existed October my senior year of high school. <br> <br>When I finally got my acceptance or rejection letters, I had to make a choice on where to go. I took into account the school's location, what they offer, and if I had
                            family in the area. Northwestern checked all of my boxes. I decided to go to NU. Remember, I never saw the campus in person, I only knew it existed for around six months, and the most research I did about the school were if
                            they had the major I want, and if they are "good."&nbsp;<br><br>Did I make the right choice?</p>

                        <h4>Yes, I did</h4>
                        <p>I enjoy being at Northwestern. The location is great, I love my classes eventhough I get destroyed by them, the people I met are great, and I got to try new things.</p>
                        <h4>Location, Location, Location!!!</h4>

                                <p>I was born in the Chicago area, but too young to enjoy most of the things there. Now that I am back, I got to explore the city and enjoy the theaters, museums, parks, buildings, and so much more. It also gave me this feeling
                                    of nostalgia with things I remembered like The Loop or Navy Pier.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also got to reconnect with family. Not only did my parents move to Chicago when they first came to America, but also many other
                                    family members, and the majority of them stayed here. I honestly haven't seen them in so long it was like stepping out of a time machine.<br><br>The campus is also at a great spot. I get to see the lake, transportation
                                    to the city is readily available, and everything on campus is relatively close together.<br><br>Overall great I just wish I wasn't harassed by the cold.</p>

                                <p>They are hard and will make you reevaluate your life choices, but you learn a lot from them. All the teachers I have so far cared a great deal about their field, and most of them can teach well.<br><br>Majority of the professors
                                    I got are so down to earth and can talk about anything. Having conversations with these guys are great. They also have a lot of wisdom to give you in either your field or life in general. Some professors that come to
                                    my mind are Sara Sood, Robert J. Gordan, Ken Park, Ian Horswill, and Sara Hernandez.<br><br><br></p>
